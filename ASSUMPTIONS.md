# Assumptions

1. This is a marketing/brand site (not the app) to visualize the new “Captain Joy / Superhero Utility” direction.
2. We’ll create multiple distinct homepage concept routes (e.g. `/concept-a`, `/concept-b`, `/concept-c`).
3. Tailwind will be used, but driven by a small set of CSS variables/tokens for brand consistency.
4. Vercel deployment is explicitly authorized by Nate for this repo.
